# REST API Demo

Minimal Node.js + Express app that serves two HTML pages:

- `/` - Welcome page
- `/about` - About page

## Requirements
- Node.js (18+ recommended)

## Quick start (PowerShell)

```powershell
# install dependencies
npm install

# start server (listens on 3000 by default)
npm start
# then open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser

# run tests
npm test
```

To change the port (PowerShell):

```powershell
$env:PORT=4000; npm start
```

## Verification

I ran the project's tests locally in this workspace; both tests passed verifying the `/` and `/about` pages return 200 and contain the expected content.

Test summary:

- Tests run: 2
- Passed: 2

If you want me to commit these files to a git repo or publish the project, tell me the target and I will prepare the commit.
